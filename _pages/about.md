I am currently a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, advised by [Sangwon Hyun](https://sangwon-hyun.org). Before joining UCSC, I earned my M.S. in Data Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and my B.S. in Statistics from Zhongnan University of Economics and Law.

My research interests include semi-supervised learning, uncertainty quantification, functional data analysis, and interpretable statistical and machine learning. More broadly, I am interested in developing principled statistical methods that are both theoretically grounded and practically useful for solving scientific problems. My current work focuses on modeling oceanography and biological sciences. I enjoy working at the intersection of methodology and applications, especially when collaboration with domain scientists helps shape the questions we ask and the tools we build.
